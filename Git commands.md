## Git Squash

When making a lot of minor changes to your repository, commit histories can quickly get out of hand. To avoid this, git squash can combine all those edits into one commit.  

eg.  

Comit4 <- Comit3 <- Comit2 <- Comit1  
can turn into  
Comit5  
which collates all from commits 1 through 4 into one commit.  

This is typically used to create one commit to merge branches.
